A certain grade of steel is graded according to the following conditions
i) Hardness must be greater than 50
ii) Carbon content must be less than 7
iii) Tensile strength must be greater than 5600
The grades are as follows
Grade is 10 if all the three conditions are met
 Grade is 9 if conditions (i) and (ii) are met
 Grade is 8 if conditions (ii) and (iii) are met
 Grade is 7 if conditions (i) and (iii) are met
 Grade is 6 if only one condition is met
 Grade is 5 if none of the conditions are met.
Write a flowgram that accepts the hardness, carbon content and tensile strength and 
displays the appropriate steel grade for the given input.A certain grade of steel is graded according to the following conditions
